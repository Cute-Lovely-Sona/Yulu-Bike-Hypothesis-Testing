# 🚲 Yulu - Hypothesis Testing Business Case

Yulu is India’s leading micro-mobility platform providing electric cycles for short-distance travel. In this project, I analyzed the **factors that influence demand for rental bikes** using statistical tests like T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square test.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Due to a drop in revenue, Yulu wants to understand:
- Which variables significantly affect electric cycle rentals?
- How well these variables explain the variation in demand?

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

**Target Variable:** `count` – total number of cycles rented  
**Important Variables:** season, workingday, weather, temp, humidity, windspeed

---

## 📊 EDA Highlights

> 📌 Dataset was explored using visual and statistical summaries.

- Checked missing values, data types, and descriptive stats
- Plotted histograms, boxplots, and countplots
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
- Explored effect of season, weather, and workingday on rentals

---

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing Performed

- ✅ **T-test**: Compared rentals on working vs. non-working days  
- ✅ **ANOVA**: Tested if rentals differ across seasons and weather  
- ✅ **Chi-square test**: Checked if season and weather are related

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **SciPy** – statistical testing

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Rentals are **higher on working days**
- **Seasons and weather** both have significant impact on rentals
- Weather and season are **statistically dependent**

---

## 📌 Project Outcome

Yulu can optimize their operations and improve fleet allocation by:
- Focusing on peak working days  
- Preparing for seasonal/weather-driven demand patterns
